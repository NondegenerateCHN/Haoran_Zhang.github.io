<div style="text-align: justify">
Thanks for stopping by. My name is Haoran Zhang. I am currently a PhD candicate at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in the Integrated Microwave Packaging Antennas and Circuits Technology (IMPACT) lab. My research focus on the millimeter and sub-Terahertz antenna/array designs for high data-rate communication. I am particularly interested in realizing the antenna design in the high-lelvel integration form of antenna-in-package (AiP) and antenna-on-chip (AoC).  

I am always happy to talk about research, outdoor activities, photography, or science communication. Whether looking for a research collaborator or outdoor activities partner, do not hesitate to email me and/or follow me on social media.
