RPWs represent one of the most debilitating pests for palm trees all over the world, due to their destructive behavior and rapid reproduction. Hence, detailed information on the biological behavior and dynamics of RPW is needed to support risk assessment of identified infestations such as dispersal ranges. In order to monitor RPW, tracking system needs to be attached or mounted on the RPW’s body. However, the available area on RPW’s back is only around 8 mm × 8 mm for the placement of the tracking system. The overall tracking system should be lightweight and small so that it will not affect the insect’s normal movement and behavior. The very small available space makes it a challenging design and thus the tracking system, especially the antenna part, must be comprehensively miniaturized without losing much on the performance.

In this work propose an electrically small inverted F antenna which is realized on the BLE system package, qualifying it as an antenna in package (AiP) design. The antenna has been designed with the embedded electronics and has a highly compact size of 0.05λ ×
0.05λ × 0.025λ. It is very well matched at 2.48 GHz with 17 MHz bandwidth. It demonstrates a maximum detection range of 300 meters.
